# This is an example of how to add further sources by installing files in this
# directory.  This file contains only comments, and does nothing.
#
# This file has the same syntax as /etc/debtags/sources.list, and all files in
# /etc/debtags/sources.list.d/ are read as if they were concatenated at the end
# of /etc/debtags/sources.list
#
# A package that would like to provide a local tag source, should do four things
# things:
#
#  1. Depend on debtags (>= 1.7.3)
#
#  2. Install vocabulary data (vocabulary.gz) and tag data (tags-current.gz) in
#     some directory (usually something like /usr/share/packagename)
#
#  3. Install in /etc/debtags/sources.list.d/ a file containing a few
#     introductory comments and the line:
#
#     tags file:/usr/share/packagename
#
#  4. In postinst, invoke debtags update --local if the debtags executable is
#     installed:
#
#     test -x /usr/bin/debtags && debtags update --local
#
#     Since Debtags calls debtags update --local in postinst as well, this will
#     guarantee that at the end of the apt or dpkg run, the new tags will be
#     installed independently of the order of invocation of the postinsts.
