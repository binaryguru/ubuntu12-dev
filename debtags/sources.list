# Source locations to get tag database info
#
# You can specify more than one; during update, debtags will merge the contents
# of all the sources.  The merged data can be found in
# /var/lib/debtags/package-tags and /var/lib/debtags/vocabulary.
#
# To contribute tags, please visit http://debtags.alioth.debian.org/todo.html

# Reviewed tag data from the APT Packages file
#tags apt://


# Package rating from http://www.iterating.org
#tags http://www.iterating.org/tags


# Regularly updated, but unchecked, database on the web
#
# If you plan to use Stable, please be aware that online tag
# databases are more likely to track Testing/Unstable; so be careful
# about downloading tags from them, and please check if tags are still
# accurate for current package versions before contributing them upstream

# Example of locally maintained custom tag data
#
# You can provide your own tag data.  To do so, place a file called
# vocabulary.gz and a file called tags-current.gz in a directory, and use the
# directory as a tag source.
#
# In the example given below, you would place the tag data in
# /etc/debtags/mytags/tags-current.gz, and the vocabulary data in
# /etc/debtags/mytags/vocabulary.gz
#
# The format of tags-current.gz is described in the tagcoll(1) manpage and the
# file is similar to /var/lib/debtags/package-tags.
#
# The format of vocabulary.gz is like the Debian Packages file, and the file is
# similar to /var/lib/debtags/vocabulary.
