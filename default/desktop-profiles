# This determines how the desktop-profiles agent script deals with the 
# situation where the environment are already set by some other agent:
# - autocrat: assume desktop-profiles is the only actor allowed to touch 
#             the environment variables and ignore current setting of the
#             environment variables (this is also known as BOFH mode)
# - rude    : profiles activated by desktop-profiles take precedence over 
#             those already set in the environment variables
# - polite  : profiles activated by desktop-profiles give precedence to those 
#             already set in the environment variables
#             (allows user to override desktop-profiles)
# - sheep   : always follow the set environment variables 
#             (i.e. don't do anything, essentially deactivates desktop-profiles)

# Disabling profile kinds you don't need used to cause a noticable decrease
